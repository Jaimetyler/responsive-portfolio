                    My name is Jaime Tyler. I grew up in Rincon, Ga and currently live there today. I am married and have 3 childen; an 8 year old daughter and boy-girl twins. I have been working in 3PL Logistics for over 3 years doing various jobs from documentation and forwarding for exports to dispatching and managing hundreds of trucks loads of cotton and other commodites every day. 

                    I have loved computers my whole life and always picked things up on them relatively quickly with little effort. I am looking fowardard to turning this portfolio into something great.
